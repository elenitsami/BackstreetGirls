                                            Can you handle these choke-inducing hard candy balls?</li>
                                            
                                            <li> The California Raisins
                                            Anyone can imagine what happens when singing groups and music bands are edible? Wish One Direction were too, right?</li>
                                            
                                            <li> Cool Ranch Doritos
                                            Once upon a time, there was an original turquoise-flecked triangular chip. With actual fat…rings a bell?</li>
                                            
                                            <li> Tri-Color Pasta Salad
                                            Because one-color pasta are too mainstream.</li>
                                            
                                            <li>Orange Julius
                                            Pretty much just orange juice…but…it’s the Julius kind.</li>
                                            
                                            <li>Equal
                                            Will probably kill you with evil toxins very slowly. One little blue package. Especially in baby blue. Baby blue would never hurt us…wow seems like the ones you give your trust to hurt you the most huh?</li>
                                            
                                            <li> Artificially Flavored Fruit Snacks
                                            Did you have one of the cool moms who bought you Fruit by the Foot, Gushers, or Fruit Roll-Ups? Mine didn't (she opted for real fruit) and is still paying the therapist bills. Because yay.</li>
                                            
                                            <li>Tab Cola
                                            Just Diet Coke hiding in a fuchsia can? </li>
                                            
                                            <li>Lean Cuisine
                                            Scientists realized they could create "healthy" chicken teriyaki meals from sodium phosphates, modified cornstarch, high-fructose corn syrup, and caramel color. Reminds a bit of today?</li>
                                            
                                            <li> Capri Sun
                                            Straw-stabbing styles got very personal with Capri Sun. Just don't stab straight through to the other side. </li>
